The Prompt Playground is a unique feature that allows developers to visualize, iterate, and version prompts, thereby enhancing the development/debugging process.

Whether you're dealing with multi-step agents or trying to understand why a completion didn't turn out as expected, the Prompt Playground provides a clear view of the exact prompt sent to the LLM, including the template, variables, LLM settings, and provider. This feature not only helps in identifying issues but also allows you to modify the prompt or change the LLM settings or provider for better results.

Moreover, the Prompt Playground also offers versioning capabilities, enabling you to keep track of prompt versions over time, which is crucial for maintaining stability and improving performance.

This documentation will guide you through the various functionalities of the Prompt Playground, helping you make the most of this powerful tool. Let's dive in!
