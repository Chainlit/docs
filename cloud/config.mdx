title: Config
---

When running `chainlit run ...` for the first time, a toml config file will automatically be generated.

```toml config.toml
[project]
# If true (default), the app will be available to anonymous users.
# If false, users will need to authenticate and be part of the project to use the app.
public = true

# The project ID (found on https://cloud.chainlit.io).
# If provided, all the message data will be stored in the cloud.
# The project ID is required when public is set to false.
#id = ""

# Uncomment if you want to persist the chats.
# local will create a database in your .chainlit directory (requires node.js installed).
# cloud will use the Chainlit cloud database.
# custom will load use your custom client.
# database = "local"

# Whether to enable telemetry (default: true). No personal data is collected.
enable_telemetry = true

# List of environment variables to be provided by each user to use the app.
user_env = []

[UI]
# Name of the app and chatbot.
name = "Chatbot"

# Description of the app and chatbot. This is used for HTML tags.
# description = ""

# The default value for the expand messages settings.
default_expand_messages = false

# Hide the chain of thought details from the user in the UI.
hide_cot = false

# Link to your github repo. This will add a github button in the UI's header.
# github = ""
```

<Note>
  If you do not see that config file, run `chainlit init` at the root of your
  app.
</Note>

## Adding your project ID

In that file, under `[project]`, uncomment the id property and paste the project ID you obtained in the previous section:

```toml
id = "test-MbHXZmUMAnxX"
```

## Make your app private

By setting the boolean `public` to `false`, you can make your app private. This means that users will need to authenticate as well as be a part of your team to use your app.
