If your organization can't use third party cloud services for data hosting, we can provide your company with a self-hostable Chainlit Cloud docker image (under commercial license).

## Define your Chainlit Server

Once you are hosting your own Chainlit Cloud instance, you can point to the server for data persistence.
You will need to use the `CHAINLIT_SERVER` environment variable.

Modify the `.env` file next to your Chainlit application.

```shell .env
CHAINLIT_SERVER="https://cloud.your_chainlit.io"
```

Alternatively, inlined:

```shell
CHAINLIT_SERVER="https://cloud.your_chainlit.io" chainlit run main.py
```

## Activating Cloud Mode

Using your own Chainlit Cloud instance, you will need to provide a valid API key to persist the data as described in [Data Persistence Getting Started](/cloud/persistence/getting-started). 

Once activated, your chats and elements will be stored in your own Cloud.
