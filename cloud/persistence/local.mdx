title: Local
---

This is the simplest way to persist data during development. Chats will be saved in the `.chainlit/chat.db` (SQLite database), and files will be stored in the `.chainlit/chat_files` folder.

<Note>
  A working Node.js installation is required to use local mode, as it relies on
  the Prisma CLI.

## Authentication

`Local` mode supports authentication but does not require it.

If authentication is enabled, chats authors will be set according to the user email.
If authentication is not enabled, all chats will have author `LocalUser` and role `owner`.

## Enable

To enable local persistence, update the database field in your config file `.chainlit/config.toml`:

```toml
[project]
database = "local"
```

## Disable

To disable local persistence, comment or remove the `database` field in your config file.
If you also want to delete the data, delete the `.chainlit/chat.db` file and `.chainlit/chat_files` folder.
