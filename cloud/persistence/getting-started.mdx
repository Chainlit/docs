## Activating Data Persistence

After creating a Chainlit Project and an API key for said project. You will need to pass the key via a `CHAINLIT_API_KEY` environment variable.

Next to your Chainlit application, create a `.env` file and modify it like so:

```shell .env
CHAINLIT_API_KEY="your key"
```

Or inlined:

```shell
CHAINLIT_API_KEY="your key" chainlit run main.py
```

Once activated, your chats and elements will be persisted in Chainlit Cloud.

## Chat history

To enable chat history in your Chainlit app, you must setup data persistence AND [authentication](/authentication).

## Deactivation

If you wish to deactivate data persistence, simply comment out or remove the `CHAINLIT_API_KEY` environment variable.
