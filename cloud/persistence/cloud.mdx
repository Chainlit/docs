Chainlit Cloud offers a swift and efficient solution for setting up data storage.

## User Authentication

`Cloud` mode requires user authentication. Detailed instructions on enabling authentication can be found [here](/cloud/authentication).

Users assigned the `user` role will have exclusive access to their individual chat history under the `history` tab. Conversely, users with `admin` or `owner` roles will have unrestricted access to all chat histories.

## Activating Chainlit Cloud Mode

Once authentication is enabled, your `public` and `id` fields should be configured as follows:

```toml
[project]
# These fields should already be configured
public = false
id = "my-project-id"

# Add the following line
database = "cloud"
```

## Deactivation

If you wish to deactivate Chainlit Cloud, simply comment out or remove the `database` field in your configuration file.
