By default, your Chainlit app does not retain the chats and elements it generates. However, the ability to store and utilize this data can be a crucial part of your project or organization.

Chainlit offers multiple persistence modes, each designed for a specific use case.

Before diving in, let's explore the new features that data persistence will introduce to your application.

## User Feedback

When data persistence is enabled, each message sent by your application will be accompanied by thumbs up and thumbs down icons. This feature allows your users to give spontaneous and direct feedback on specific interactions.

## Conversation History

### Through Chainlit App

Past conversations will be stored and made available in the 'history' tab. This feature allows you to navigate, apply filters, delete, or simply visualize **your** previous chats.

### Through Chainlit Cloud

As an admin, this feature allows you to access the history of past conversations through the Chainlit Cloud interface. Giving you the visibility over **all** project's conversations.
