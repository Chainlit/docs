title: Add Authentication
---

In order to ensure privacy and security, you may want to require users to authenticate before accessing your Chainlit application. This document guides you through the process of setting up user authentication for your Chainlit app.

## Step 1: Create a Chainlit Project

A Chainlit project corresponds to a single Chainlit application.

To create a new project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [Chainlit Cloud](https://cloud.chainlit.io) and sign in.
2. Click on the '+' icon to create a new project. You will see a screen similar to the one below:

## Step 2: Enable User Authentication

After creating the project, you need to copy the Project ID.

<Note>Click on the Project ID to copy it to your clipboard.</Note>

Next, you will need to modify the configuration file of your Chainlit application. The configuration file is located at `./chainlit/config.toml` in your Chainlit application's directory.

Make the following changes to the configuration file:

```toml config.toml
[project]
# Change the public setting to false to enable authentication
public = false

# Paste the copied project ID here
id = "your-project-id"
```

<Note>
  If your project or organization has unique authentication requirements, please
  reach out to us on Discord for assistance.
</Note>

Once these changes are made and your application is restarted, users will be required to authenticate and be a part of your project before they can access your application.
