title: Deployment

After you've successfully set up and tested your Chainlit application locally, the next step is to make it accessible to a wider audience by deploying it to a hosting service. This guide provides various options for self-hosting your Chainlit app, along with critical information you should be aware of before deploying.

## Self-host

<Warning>
  Currently, you have to serve your Chainlit app from the root of your
  domain/subdomain. This means that you can't serve it from a subdirectory like
  `example.com/my-app`.
