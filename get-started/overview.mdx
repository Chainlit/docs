In the earlier versions of Chainlit, the factory concept was included as part of the API. However, after receiving feedback and evaluating its usefulness, the developers decided to remove it in order to simplify the API and avoid confusion among users.

In the latest version of Chainlit, you will no longer find the following APIs: langchain_factory, langchain_run, langchain_postprocess, llama_index_factory, and langflow_factory.

## Key features

1. [Build fast:](/examples/openai-sql) Integrate seamlessly with an existing code base or start from scratch in minutes

2. [Data persistence:](/chat-data/overview) Leverage user generated data + feedback.

3. [Visualize multi-steps reasoning:](/observability-iteration/chain-of-thought) Understand the intermediary steps that produced an output at a glance

4. [Iterate on prompts:](/observability-iteration/prompt-playground) Deep dive into prompts in the Prompt Playground to understand where things went wrong and iterate

## Integrations

Chainlit is compatible with all Python programs and libraries. That being said, it comes with a set of integrations with popular libraries and frameworks.
