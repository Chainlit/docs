title: Password
---

The `@cl.password_auth_callback` receives the username and password from the login form. Returning an `AppUser` object will authenticate the user while returning `None` will fail the authentication.

You can verify the credentials against any service that you'd like (your own DB, a private google sheet etc.).

<Warning>
  The usual security best practices applies here, hash password before storing
  them.
</Warning>

## Example

```python
from typing import Optional
import chainlit as cl

@cl.password_auth_callback
def auth_callback(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[cl.AppUser]:
  # Fetch the user matching username from your database
  # and compare the hashed password with the value stored in the database
  if (username, password) == ("admin", "admin"):
    return cl.AppUser(username="admin", role="ADMIN", provider="credentials")
  else:
    return None
```
