title: Password
---

This authentication allows you to plug your existing user database to the Chainlit app. You receive the username and password from the login form, and you need to return an `AppUser` object if the authentication is successful.

You can use the callback to make sure the user exists in your database and that the password is correct.

<Warning>
  You are responsible for hashing the user passwords before storing them in your database.
</Warning>

## Example

```python
from typing import Optional
from chainlit.types import AppUser
import chainlit as cl

@cl.password_auth_callback
def auth_callback(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[AppUser]:
  # Fetch the user matching username from your database
  # and compare the hashed password with the value stored in the database
  if (username, password) == ("admin", "admin"):
    return AppUser(username="admin", role="ADMIN", provider="credentials")
  else:
    return None
```
