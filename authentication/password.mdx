title: Password
---

The `@cl.password_auth_callback` receives the username and password from the login form. Returning an `cl.User` object will authenticate the user while returning `None` will fail the authentication.

You can verify the credentials against any service that you'd like (your own DB, a private google sheet etc.).

<Warning>
  The usual security best practices applies here, hash password before storing
  them.
</Warning>

## Example

```python
from typing import Optional
import chainlit as cl

@cl.password_auth_callback
def auth_callback(username: str, password: str):
    # Fetch the user matching username from your database
    # and compare the hashed password with the value stored in the database
    if (username, password) == ("admin", "admin"):
        return cl.User(
            identifier="admin", metadata={"role": "admin", "provider": "credentials"}
        )
    else:
        return None
```
