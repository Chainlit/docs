[Literal AI](https://docs.literalai.com) is a collaborative **observability, evaluation and analytics** platform for building production-grade LLM apps. Literal AI offers multimodal logging, including vision, audio, and video.

Literal AI can be leveraged as a data persistence solution, allowing you to quickly enable data storage and analysis for your Chainlit app without setting up your own infrastructure.

<Note>
  Literal AI has a data retention policy available [here](https://literalai.com).

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the API Key in your Chainlit App">

Once you have an API key, you will need to pass it via a `LITERAL_API_KEY` environment variable.

Next to your Chainlit application, create a `.env` file and modify it like so:

```shell .env
LITERAL_API_KEY="your key"
```

Or inlined:

```shell
LITERAL_API_KEY="your key" chainlit run main.py
```

Or inlined for Windows powershell:

```shell
$ENV:LITERAL_API_KEY="your key"; chainlit run main.py
```

Once activated, your chats and elements will be persisted on Literal AI.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Debug Mode

You can enable the new debug mode by adding `-d` to your `chainlit run` command. You will see a debug button below each message taking you to the trace/prompt playground.
