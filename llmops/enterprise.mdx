If your organization can't use third party cloud services for data hosting, we can provide your company with a self-hostable Literal AI docker image (under commercial license).

) for enterprise support.

## Define your Literal AI Server

Once you are hosting your own Literal AI instance, you can point to the server for data persistence.
You will need to use the `LITERAL_API_URL` environment variable.

Modify the `.env` file next to your Chainlit application.

```shell .env
LITERAL_API_URL="https://cloud.your_literal.com"
```

Alternatively, inlined:

```shell
LITERAL_API_URL="https://cloud.your_literal.com" chainlit run main.py
```

## Activating Data Persistence

Using your own Literal AI instance, you will still need to provide a valid API key to persist the data as described [here](/data-persistence/overview).

Once activated, your chats and elements will be stored on your own server.
