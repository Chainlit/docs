## Use your Logo

Chainlit Application offers support for both dark and light modes. To accommodate this, prepare two versions of your logo, named `logo_dark.png` and `logo_light.png`. Place these logos in a `/public` folder next to your application. Once you restart the application, your custom logos should be displayed accordingly.

## Use your Favicon

To further enhance branding, you can also update the application's favicon. Place an image file named `favicon` in the `public` folder next to your application. After restarting the application, the new favicon will take effect.
