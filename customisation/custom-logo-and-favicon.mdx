## Use your Logo

Chainlit Application offers support for both dark and light modes. To accommodate this, prepare two versions of your logo, named `logo_dark.png` and `logo_light.png`. Place these logos in a `/public` folder next to your application. Once you restart the application, your custom logos should be displayed accordingly.

## Use your Favicon

To further enhance branding, you can also update the application's favicon. Place an image file named `favicon` in the `public` folder next to your application. After restarting the application, the new favicon will take effect.

## Customize Login Page Background image

If authentication is enabled, a background image (defaulting to the Chainlit logo) will be displayed on the login page.
You can customize it by editing the following fields of your `.chainlit/config.toml` file.

```toml config.toml
[UI]
# Custom login page image, relative to public directory or external URL
login_page_image = "/public/custom-background.jpg"

# Custom login page image filter (Tailwind internal filters, no dark/light variants)
# login_page_image_filter = "brightness-50 grayscale"
# login_page_image_dark_filter = "contrast-200 blur-sm"
```
