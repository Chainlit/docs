title: Avatars
---

The default assistant avatar is the favicon of the application. See how to customize the favicon [here](/customisation/custom-logo-and-favicon).

However, you can customize the avatar by placing an image file in the `/public/avatars` folder.
The image file should be named after the author of the message. For example, if the author is `My Assistant`, the avatar should be named `my_assistant.png`.

```
public/
└── avatars/
    └── my_assistant.png
```
