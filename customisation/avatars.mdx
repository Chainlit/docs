title: Avatars
---

The default assistant avatar is the favicon of the application.

However, you can customize the avatar by placing an image file in the `/public/avatars` folder.
The image file should be named after the author of the message. For example, if the author is `My Assistant`, the avatar should be named `my-assistant.png`.
