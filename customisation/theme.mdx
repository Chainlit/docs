Looking to refresh your app's appearance? You can easily alter the default theme colors in your `config.toml` file.

Currently, you have the freedom to modify:

- **Background color**: This option allows you to change the color of the app's background.
- **Paper color**: This alters the color of the 'paper' elements within the app, such as the navbar, widgets, etc.
- **Primary color**: This encompasses three shades - main, dark, and light. These colors are primarily used for interactive interface elements.

<Note>
  If you started your Chainlit app with -w (file watcher), it will refresh every
  time you update the theme!

## Default Theme

To set the default theme, navigate to the `[UI.theme]` section in your `config.toml` file and update the `default` value.

```bash config.toml
[UI.theme]
    default = "dark"
```

## Light Theme Modification

To modify the light theme, find or create the `[UI.theme.light]` section and update the colors as per your preference.

```bash config.toml
[UI.theme.light]
    background = "#110061"
    paper = "#FFFFFF"

    [UI.theme.light.primary]
        main = "#110061"
        dark = "#180039"
        light = "#FFE7EB"
```

## Dark Theme Modification

To alter the dark theme, the section begins with `[UI.theme.dark]`.

```bash config.toml
[UI.theme.dark]
    background = "#FAFAFA"
    paper = "#FFFFFF"

    [UI.theme.dark.primary]
        main = "#A80061"
        dark = "#380039"
        light = "#FFE7EB"
```
