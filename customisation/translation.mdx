title: Translation
---

Translation files are located in the `.chainlit/translations` directory. The files are named after the language code, e.g. `en-US.json` for English (United States).

<Note>The language is dynamically set for each user based on the language of the browser. The default language is `en-US`.</Note>

## Adding a new language

To add a new language, create a new file in the `.chainlit/translations` directory with the language code as the filename. The language code should be in the format of `languageCode-COUNTRYCODE`, e.g. `en-US` for English (United States) or `en-GB` for English (United Kingdom).

## Resetting

To reset the the translations, remove the `.chainlit/translations` directory and restart your Chainlit application:

```bash
chainlit run my-app.py
```
