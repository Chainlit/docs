title: Translation
---

Translation files are located in the `.chainlit/translations` directory. The files are named after the language code, e.g. `en-US.json` for English (United States).

<Note>
  The language is dynamically set for each user based on the language of the
  browser. The default language is `en-US`.
</Note>

## Adding a new language

To add a new language, create a new file in the `.chainlit/translations` directory with the language code as the filename. The language code should be in the format of `languageCode-COUNTRYCODE`, e.g. `en-US` for English (United States) or `en-GB` for English (United Kingdom).

## Lint translations

To lint the translations, run the following command:

```bash
chainlit lint-translations
```

## Translate chainlit.md file

You can define multiple translations for the `chainlit.md` file. For instance `chainlit_pt-BR.md` for Portuguese (Brazil) and `chainlit_es-ES.md` for Spanish (Spain).
The file will be loaded based on the browser's language, defaulting to `chainlit.md` if no translation is available.

## Resetting

To reset the the translations, remove the `.chainlit/translations` directory and restart your Chainlit application:

```bash
chainlit run my-app.py
```
