You can inject a custom JavaScript script into the application by adding the following to your `config.toml`:

```toml config.toml
[UI]
# ...
# This can either be a css file in your `public` dir or a URL
custom_js = '/public/my_js_script.js'
```

Once the configuration is updated, restart the application. Your custom script will now be loaded.
