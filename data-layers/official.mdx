  Out-of-the-box data layer schema to store your threads, steps, feedback, etc.

<Warning>
Do not forget to have your Chainlit application point to the database you set up by
adding the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env`.  

If you wish to store elements, the same goes for your cloud configuration.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Custom element `props` are stored directly in PostgreSQL, not on cloud storage.
