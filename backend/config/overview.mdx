The `.chainlit/config.toml` file is created when you run `chainlit run ...` or `chainlit init`. It allows you to configure your Chainlit app and to enable/disable specific features.

You can also dynamically override specific `config.toml` variables by Chat Profile at runtime. See [Dynamic Profile-based Configuration](/api-reference/lifecycle-hooks/on-profile-switch) for details.

It is composed of three sections:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="project"
    icon="rocket-launch"
    color="#ea5a0c"
    href="/backend/config/project"
  >
    Project configuration.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="features"
    icon="flag"
    color="#0285c7"
    href="/backend/config/features"
  >
    Enable/disable features.
  </Card>
  <Card title="UI" icon="palette" color="#16a34a" href="/backend/config/ui">
    UI configuration.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
