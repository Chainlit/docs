title: "Elements"

Text messages are the building blocks of a chatbot, but we often want to send more than just text to the user. We want to send images, videos, and other types of data. Chainlit provides a simple way to send these elements to the user interface and gives you control on how and where to display them.

## How it works

Once an element is sent to the user interface, the user interface will render the element based on the following:

- Whether the element is [scoped](#scoped-elements) or [global](#global-elements)
- Whether the element's name is explicitly mentioned in a message
- The [display option](#display-options) of the element

## Display Options

There are display options that determine how an element is rendered in the context where it is being used. The `ElementDisplay` type represents these options. The following display options are available:

### Side

This will display the element on a sidebar. The sidebar is hidden by default and opened upon element reference click.

### Page

This will display the element on a separate page. The user will be redirected to the page upon element reference click.

### Inline

This will display the element below the message. If the element is global, the element will only be displayed if the element is explicitly mentioned in the message. If the element is scoped, the element will be displayed regardless of whether it is explicitly mentioned in the message.

## Global Elements

To better understand global elements, let's look an example.

```python Code Example
import chainlit as cl


@cl.on_chat_start
async def start():
    # Send the elements globally
    await cl.Image(path="./cat.jpeg", name="image1", display="inline").send()
    await cl.Text(content="Here is a side text document", name="text1", display="side").send()
    await cl.Text(content="Here is a page text document", name="text2", display="page").send()

    # Send the same message twice
    content = "Here is image1, a nice image of a cat! As well as text1 and text2!"

    await cl.Message(
        content=content,
    ).send()

    await cl.Message(
        content=content,
    ).send()
```

If we look at the rendering of the above code, we can see that the elements are displayed in BOTH of the messages.
Global elements means that the elements are not scoped to a specific message. They are available to all messages.

## Scoped Elements

Scoped elements are elements that are scoped to a specific message. To better understand scoped elements, let's look at an example.

```python Code Example
import chainlit as cl


@cl.on_chat_start
async def start():
    # Send the first message without the elements
    content = "Here is image1, a nice image of a cat! As well as text1 and text2!"

    await cl.Message(
        content=content,
    ).send()

    elements = [
        cl.Image(path="./cat.jpeg", name="image1", display="inline"),
        cl.Text(content="Here is a side text document", name="text1", display="side"),
        cl.Text(content="Here is a page text document", name="text2", display="page"),
    ]

    # Send the second message with the elements
    await cl.Message(
        content=content,
        elements=elements,
    ).send()
```

If we look at the rendering of the above code, we can see that the elements are only displayed in the second message.
Scoped elements means that the elements can only be displayed in a specific message.
