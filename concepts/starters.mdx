Starters are suggestions to help your users get started with your assistant.
You can declare up to 4 starters and optionally define an icon for each one.

```python starters.py
import chainlit as cl

@cl.set_starters
async def set_starters():
    return [
        cl.Starter(
            label="Morning routine ideation",
            message="Can you help me create a personalized morning routine that would help increase my productivity throughout the day? Start by asking me about my current habits and what activities energize me in the morning.",
            icon="/public/idea.svg",
            ),

        cl.Starter(
            label="Explain superconductors",
            message="Explain superconductors like I'm five years old.",
            icon="/public/learn.svg",
            ),
        cl.Starter(
            label="Python script for daily email reports",
            message="Write a script to automate sending daily email reports in Python, and walk me through how I would set it up.",
            icon="/public/terminal.svg",
            ),
        cl.Starter(
            label="Text inviting friend to wedding",
            message="Write a text asking a friend to be my plus-one at a wedding next month. I want to keep it super short and casual, and offer an out.",
            icon="/public/write.svg",
            )
        ]
# ...

## With Chat Profiles

Starters also work with [Chat Profiles](/advanced-features/chat-profiles). You can define different starters for different chat profiles.

```python starters_with_chat_profiles.py
@cl.set_chat_profiles
async def chat_profile(current_user: cl.User):
    if current_user.metadata["role"] != "ADMIN":
        return None

    return [
        cl.ChatProfile(
            name="My Chat Profile",
            icon="https://picsum.photos/250",
            markdown_description="The underlying LLM model is **GPT-3.5**, a *175B parameter model* trained on 410GB of text data.",
            starters=[
                cl.Starter(
                    label="Morning routine ideation",
                    message="Can you help me create a personalized morning routine that would help increase my productivity throughout the day? Start by asking me about my current habits and what activities energize me in the morning.",
                    icon="/public/idea.svg",
                ),
                cl.Starter(
                    label="Explain superconductors",
                    message="Explain superconductors like I'm five years old.",
                    icon="/public/learn.svg",
                ),
            ],
        )
    ]
```
