title: Custom CSS

Chainlit Application allows for design customization through the use of a custom CSS stylesheet. To enable this, modify your configuration settings in .chainlit/config.toml.

```toml config.toml
[UI]
# ...
# This can either be a css file in your `public` dir or a URL
custom_css = 'public/stylesheet.css'
```

Once the configuration is updated, restart the application. Your custom styling will now be applied.
