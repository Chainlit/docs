You can customize the Chainlit application with your own logo.

## Use your Logo

Chainlit Application offers support for both dark and light modes. To accommodate this, prepare two versions of your logo, named logo_dark and logo_light. Place these logos in the frontend/public folder. Once you rebuild the frontend and restart the application, your custom logos should be displayed accordingly.

## Use your Favicon

To further enhance branding, you can also update the application's favicon. Place an image file named favicon in the frontend/public folder. After rebuilding the frontend and restarting the application, the new favicon will take effect.
