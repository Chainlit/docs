title: Template & Variables
---

As we use LLMs for more complex tasks, prompts are growing longer and are often formatted on the fly with variables.

This is making the development process significantly harder. One template could work with a certain set of variables and break with another.
The developer experience is also impacted since printing large texts in a notebook/terminal is far from ideal.

The Template & Variables feature tackles those issue by providing a segmented visualization of your prompts.

## Setup

If you did not already setup the Prompt Template, go [here](/concepts/prompt-playground/setup).
Once this is done, open the Prompt Playground.

## Template View

The template view will only be displayed if the `template` property is set in your [Prompt](/api-reference/prompt) instance. For Chat LLMs, the `template` property is at the `PromptMessage` level.
