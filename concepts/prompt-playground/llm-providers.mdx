title: LLM Providers
---

LLM Providers allow you to configure the prompt playground so that it can work with any LLM provider.

## Provider library

We currently offer the implementation for OpenAI, Anthropic and HuggingFace. This enables you to get started quickly without having to re-implement the connection to these LLM providers.

There are three providers for OpenAI:

- `OpenAI`: supports the gpt-3 models
- `ChatOpenAI`: supports the gpt-3.5 and gpt-4 models
- `AzureChatOpenAI`: supports the Azure-hosted gpt-3.5 and gpt-4 models

Note that HugginFace contains currently one provider `HFFlanT5` that gives access to the Flan Alpaca Large model.

## Custom provider

You can define your own provider to connect with your LLM provider of choice. Below is an example of how it would look like.

The `create_completion` method is required, it is where you should place the logic where you communicate with your LLM provider.

The environment variables are required to auto-detect which provider is configured. Chainlit only shows configured LLM providers in the prompt playground.

The `inputs` is a list of controls that this LLM provider offers that Chainlit will display in the side panel of the prompt playground.

The `is_chat` property is a toggle to define whether you feed a list of messages to the LLM provider (like OpenAI's `gpt-4` model) or one text string (like Anthropic's `claude-2` model).


```python
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse

from chainlit.input_widget import Select, Slider
from chainlit.playground.provider import BaseProvider


class ExampleProvider(BaseProvider):

    async def create_completion(self, request):
        await super().create_completion(request)

        return StreamingResponse(content="completion content")


example_env_vars = {"api_key": "EXAMPLE_API_KEY"}

Example = ExampleProvider(
    id="example",
    name="Example",
    env_vars=example_env_vars,
    inputs=[
        Select(
            id="model",
            label="Model",
            values=["text-001", "text-002"],
            initial_value="text-002",
        ),
        Slider(
            id="temperature",
            label="Temperature",
            min=0.0,
            max=1.0,
            step=0.01,
            initial=0.9,
        )
    ],
    is_chat=False,
)
```
