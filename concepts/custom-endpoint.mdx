title: API endpoints
---

Custom API endpoints allow you to extend Chainlit's Fast API backend with your own endpoints.
One good use case for this is to serve an agent to external services.

<Note>
  If you create or update a custom endpoint, you will have to restart your
  Chainlit process. The file watcher will not pick up changes.
</Note>

## How it works

To add a custom endpoint, import the FastAPI `app` instance from `chainlit.server` and declare your endpoint as you would in FastAPI.

```python
from chainlit.server import app
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import (
    HTMLResponse,
)


@app.get("/hello")
def hello(request: Request):
    print(request.headers)
    return HTMLResponse("Hello World")
```
