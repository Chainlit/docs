title: Chain of Thought
---

As your app grows in complexity (e.g. Chain of Thoughts, LangChain), understanding the process behind generating a specific answer can become challenging.

To help you overcome this issue, Chainlit allows you to easily explore the reasoning process right from the user interface.

Take a look at this screenshot from the [LangChain MRKL](/examples/mrkl) example:

It's evident that several intermediate steps are needed to answer the initial question. Additionally, each step might involve another tool, resulting in a tree-like structure.

Chainlit simplifies this process by enabling you to visualize and navigate through these otherwise complicated reasoning pathways.

<Note>
  You can hide the chain of thought by setting the `hide_cot` parameter to true
  in your config file!
</Note>

## How it works

If you are using the [LangChain integration](/integrations/langchain), every intermediary step is automatically sent and displayed in the Chainlit UI.

In Pure Python, you can use the `parent_id`, `prompt` and `llm_settings` parameters of the [Message](/api-reference/message) class to display the intermediary steps.
