By default, the chats and elements produced by your Chainlit app are not persisted. Persisting and utilizing this data can be an essential aspect of your app/company.

Enabling data persistence will add new features in your Chainlit app.

## Human Feedback

Each message sent by your app will have a thumb up/down icons below it, enabling users to give feedback.

## Chat History

Previous chats will be available in the `history` tab. You can browse, filter, delete and visualize previous chats.
