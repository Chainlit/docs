title: Local
---

This is the simplest way to persist data. Chats will be saved in the `.chainlit/chat.db` (SQLite database), and files will be stored in the `.chainlit/chat_files` folder. This mode does not support multiple users or authentication.

<Note>
  A working Node.js installation is required to use local mode, as it relies on
  the Prisma CLI.
</Note>

To enable local persistence, update the database field in your [config](/cloud/config) file:

```toml
[project]
database = "local"
```
