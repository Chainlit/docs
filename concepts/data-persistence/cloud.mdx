Chainlit Cloud is the preferred method for data storage, ensuring that users are authenticated and that all chats and files are securely stored in the cloud.

## User Authentication

Your app will only be accessible to members of your [Chainlit project](/cloud/create-project).

Users assigned the `user` role will only have access to their personal chat history in the `history` tab. However, users with `admin` or `owner` roles will have access to all chat histories.

## Enable Chainlit Cloud Mode

To enable Chainlit Cloud, you must first [create a project](/cloud/create-project). Following this, update your [configuration](/cloud/config) file as shown below:

```toml
[project]
public = false
id = "my-project-id"
database = "cloud"
```

## Disable

To disable Chainlit cloud, comment or remove the `database` and `id` fields in your config file. You will also need to to revert the `public` field to `true`.
