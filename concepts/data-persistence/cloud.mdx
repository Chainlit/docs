This is the recommended method for persisting data. Chats and files will be stored in Chainlit's cloud.

## Authentication

This mode will require your users to be members of your [Chainlit project](/cloud/create-project) and to authenticate through Chainlit's Auth0.

Users with role `user` will only be able to see their own chats in the `history` tab while `admin` and `owner` have access to all chats.

## Enable Cloud Mode

To enable Chainlit Cloud, first [create a project](/cloud/create-project). Then, update your [config](/cloud/config) file:

```toml
[project]
public = false
id = "my-project-id"
database = "cloud"
```
