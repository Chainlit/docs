title: "Callback Handlers"

When running your own LangChain agent, typically using [langchain_run](/api-reference/langchain/langchain-run), it is essential to provide the appropriate callback handler. This ensures seamless communication between the Chainlit UI and your agent.

There are two ways to pass the callback handler:

1. Pass the callback handler during runtime. This will apply the handler to all calls made by your agent.
2. Pass the callback handler to individual components, such as an `llm`, allowing you to control what information is returned to the UI.

### Asynchronous Callback Handler

The following code example demonstrates how to pass an asynchronous callback handler.

```python
@cl.langchain_run
async def run(agent, input_str):
    res = await agent.acall(input_str, callbacks=[cl.AsyncChainlitCallbackHandler()])
    await cl.Message(content=res["text"]).send()
```

Notice the `acall` here, that could also be `arun` or any other async function. Since we are calling the asynchronous implementation of the agent, we need to use the asynchronous callback handler.

### Synchronous Callback Handler

Alternatively, you can pass a synchronous callback handler, as shown in the example below:

```python
@cl.langchain_run
async def run(agent, input_str):
    res = await cl.make_async(agent)(input_str, callbacks=[cl.ChainlitCallbackHandler()])
    await cl.Message(content=res["text"]).send()
```

Since we are calling a long running synchronous function, we need to wrap it in `cl.make_async` to make it asynchronous and not block the event loop.
The function will still run synchronously in its own thread, hence we use the synchronous callback handler.

Choose the appropriate callback handler based on your specific requirements, ensuring seamless interaction between your LangChain agent and the Chainlit UI.
