title: "Callback Handlers"
---

When running your own LangChain agent, typically using [langchain_run](/api-reference/langchain/langchain-run), it is essential to provide the appropriate callback handler. This ensures seamless communication between the Chainlit UI and your agent.

There are two ways to pass the callback handler:

1. Pass the callback handler during runtime. This will apply the handler to all calls made by your agent.
2. Pass the callback handler to individual components, such as an `llm`, allowing you to control what information is returned to the UI.

### Asynchronous Callback Handler

The following code example demonstrates how to pass an asynchronous callback handler:

```python
@cl.langchain_run
async def run(agent, input_str):
    res = await agent.acall(input_str, callbacks=[cl.AsyncChainlitCallbackHandler()])
    await cl.Message(content=res["text"]).send()
```

### Synchronous Callback Handler

Alternatively, you can pass a synchronous callback handler, as shown in the example below:

```python
@cl.langchain_run
async def run(agent, input_str):
    res = await cl.make_async(agent)(input_str, callbacks=[cl.ChainlitCallbackHandler()])
    await cl.Message(content=res["text"]).send()
```

Choose the appropriate callback handler based on your specific requirements, ensuring seamless interaction between your LangChain agent and the Chainlit UI.
