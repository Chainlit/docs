title: "cache"
---

The `cache` decorator is a tool for caching results of resource-intensive calculations or loading processes. It can be conveniently combined with the [file watcher](/backend/command-line) to prevent resource reloading each time the application restarts. This not only saves time, but also enhances overall efficiency.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="func" type="Callable">
  The target function whose results need to be cached.
</ParamField>

## Returns

<ResponseField name="cached_value" type="Any" required>
  The computed value that is stored in the cache after its initial calculation.
</ResponseField>

## Usage

```python
import time
import chainlit as cl

@cl.cache
def to_cache():
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate a time-consuming process
    return "Hello!"

value = to_cache()

@cl.on_message
async def main(message: cl.Message):
    await cl.Message(
        content=value,
    ).send()
```

In this example, the `to_cache` function simulates a time-consuming process that returns a value. By using the `cl.cache` decorator, the result of the function is cached after its first execution. Future calls to the `to_cache` function return the cached value without running the time-consuming process again.
