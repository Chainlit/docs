Hook to react to a new websocket connection to the front end. Note: this event should be triggered on all connection/reconnection events, including after client-side (eg browser moved to background on mobile), server-side (eg timeout) or connectivity issues.

## Usage

```python
from io import BytesIO
import chainlit as cl


@cl.on_audio_chunk
async def on_audio_chunk(chunk: cl.InputAudioChunk):
    pass
```
