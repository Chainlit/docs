title: "on_chat_start"
---

Hook to react to the initial user websocket connection event. Note: this callback will only fire on the initial connection for a user's session - use `on_socket_connect` to react to the connection being reestablished.

## Usage

```python Code Example
from chainlit import AskUserMessage, Message, on_chat_start


@on_chat_start
async def main():
    res = await AskUserMessage(content="What is your name?", timeout=30).send()
    if res:
        await Message(
            content=f"Your name is: {res['output']}.\nChainlit installation is working!\nYou can now start building your own chainlit apps!",
        ).send()
```
