title: "on_chat_resume"
---

Decorator to enable users to continue a conversation.
Requires both [data persistence](/data-persistence/overview) and [authentication](/authentication) to be enabled.

This decorator will automatically:

- Send the persisted messages and elements to the UI.
- Restore the user session.

<Warning>
  Only JSON serializable fields of the user session will be saved and restored.
</Warning>

## Usage

At minimum, you will need to use the `@cl.on_chat_resume` decorator to resume conversations.

```python
@cl.on_chat_resume
async def on_chat_resume(thread):
    pass
```

However, if you are using a Langchain agent for instance, you will need to reinstantiate and set it in the user session yourself.
