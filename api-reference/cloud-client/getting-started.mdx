For enhanced flexibility in data persistence, consider using the Cloud Client directly instead of Chainlit's built-in UI for storing data in [Chainlit Cloud](/cloud/persistence/overview).

Before using the Cloud package, make sure to activate [Cloud Mode](/cloud/persistence/getting-started#activating-chainlit-cloud-mode) for your Chainlit Application.

By default the Chainlit client uses the project API key provided to the application:

```python Code Example
from chainlit.client.cloud import chainlit_client

created_user = await chainlit_client.create_app_user(app_user)
```

Alternatively you can initialize your own client with a project API key:

```python Code Example
from chainlit.client.cloud import ChainlitCloudClient

chainlit_client = ChainlitCloudClient(api_key="your_api_key_here")
```
