title: Custom Data Layer
---

Literal provides the simplest way to persist, analyze and monitor your data.

If you absolutely need to implement a custom data layer, you can do so by doing something similar to [this](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit/blob/main/cypress/e2e/data_layer/main.py).

<Note>The Chainlit team will not provide support for custom data layers.</Note>
