By default, your Chainlit app does not persist the chats and elements it generates. However, the ability to store and utilize this data can be a crucial part of your project or organization.

Once enabled, data persistence will introduce new features to your application.

## Enable Data Persistence in 1 minute

1. Navigate to [Literal AI](https://cloud.getliteral.ai) and sign in.
2. You will be prompted to create a new project:
   <Frame caption="Project Creation Screen">
     <img src="/images/create-project.png" />
   </Frame>
3. Navigate to the `Settings` page. A default API key will be generated for you
   <Frame caption="Project API Key">
     <img src="/images/api-key.png" />
   </Frame>

## Activation

Once you have an API key, you will need to pass it via a `LITERAL_API_KEY` environment variable.

Next to your Chainlit application, create a `.env` file and modify it like so:

```shell .env
LITERAL_API_KEY="your key"
```

Or inlined:

```shell
LITERAL_API_KEY="your key" chainlit run main.py
```

Or inlined for Windows powershell:

```shell
$ENV:LITERAL_API_KEY="your key"; chainlit run main.py
```

Once activated, your chats and elements will be persisted on Literal AI.

## Deactivation

If you wish to deactivate data persistence, simply comment out or remove the `LITERAL_API_KEY` environment variable.
