title: Migration Guide to Chainlit v0.7.0
---

## Updating Chainlit

Begin the migration by updating Chainlit to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade chainlit
```

Then remove your `.chainlit/config.toml` file and regenerate it:

```bash
chainlit init
```

Several fields disappeared from the config, such as `project_id`, `public` and `database`.

## Authentication

Previously, authentication was completely tied to Chainlit Cloud and not customizable by the developers.
The new system enables developer to quickly implement:

- login/password authentication
- OAuth authentication
- Header based authentication for apps running with a reverse proxy.

Check the [documentation](/authentication) to learn more about it.

## Data Persistence

Previously Chainlit was allowing for different database mode (`cloud`, `local` and `custom`). We found that it was confusing for developers and that some modes were heavily misused (like `local` db in production).

The new system is much simpler. You can create an API key on [Chainlit Cloud](https://cloud.chainlit.io/). Then set it in your `.env` and you are good to go.

We understand that data privacy is a concern for companies, that's why we made **Chainlit Cloud self hostable**.

Check the [documentation](/data-persistence/overview) to learn more about it.

## Chainlit Cloud

To facilitate the self hosting of [Chainlit Cloud](https://cloud.chainlit.io/), we had to drop third party vendors.
If you used to sign in with OAuth, everything should work out of the box.

If you used to sign in with password, click on `Forgot password?` and follow the process. You will be prompted to reset your password and verify your email.

## Removed APIs

The following APIs have been **removed**:

- `@cl.auth_client` (see new authentication)
- `@cl.db_client` (see new data persistence)

## Resources

The documentation, [examples](/examples), and [cookbook](https://github.com/Chainlit/cookbook) have been updated to reflect the new APIs. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZThrUxbAYw) server.
