## Updating Chainlit

Begin the migration by updating Chainlit to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade chainlit
```

## What changes?

Full changelog available [here](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#110---2024-05-13).

## How to migrate?

### Rename the multi_modal config setting

The `multi_modal` config setting has been renamed `spontaneous_file_upload`. You can either remove the entire `./chainlit/config.toml` file and restart your app or rename the `multi_modal` setting manually (example [here](/backend/config/features#default-configuration)).
