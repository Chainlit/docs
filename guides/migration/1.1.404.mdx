## Updating Chainlit

Begin the migration by updating Chainlit to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade chainlit
```

## Breaking Changes

### Python Version Requirement

Chainlit 1.1.404 requires Python 3.9 or higher. Ensure you're using a compatible Python version before upgrading.

### Security Changes

Chainlit now listens on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) instead of 0.0.0.0 (public) for improved security.

#### For Containerized Deployments

If you're using containerized deployments, you may need to specify `--host 0.0.0.0` for your container to work correctly with the new security changes.

## New Features and Changes

### Environment Variable for Custom Config Locations

You can now use the `CHAINLIT_APP_ROOT` environment variable to specify custom config locations.

### Improved Error Handling

- HTTP errors in data layers are now handled more gracefully.
- Fixed an AttributeError in the llama_index integration.

### Configuration Update

The `edit_message` placement in the default config has been corrected. Check your `config.toml` file and update if necessary.

## Best Practices

1. **Review Your Python Environment**: Ensure you're using Python 3.9 or higher.
2. **Update Containerized Deployments**: If using containers, adjust your configurations to include `--host 0.0.0.0` if needed.
3. **Check Custom Configurations**: If you've customized your Chainlit configuration, review it against the new defaults.
4. **Test Your Integration**: If you're using the llama_index integration, test thoroughly after upgrading.

## Additional Notes

- The frontend connection resuming after connection loss has been fixed.
- A new pytest-based testing infrastructure has been implemented for improved stability.

Remember to thoroughly test your application after upgrading to ensure compatibility with these changes.
