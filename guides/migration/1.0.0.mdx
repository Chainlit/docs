## Message

Previously, messages were both used for chat interactions and display intermediate steps.

Intermediary steps are more than just messages, they have an input and an output, a start and an end.

For this reason, we decided to remove the `parent_id`, `prompt` and `indent` fields from the `cl.Message` class and introduce a new concept: [cl.Step](/concepts/step).

Finally, the `disable_human_feedback` field has been renamed to `disable_feedback`.

## Prompt

The Chainlit `Prompt` class was mixing fields for both chat and completion LLMs.

To make it clearer, it has been split into two classes: [ChatGeneration](/api-reference/generation/chat-generation) and [CompletionGeneration](/api-reference/generation/completion-generation).

Generations are intended to be used with [Step](/api-reference/generation/chat-generation#example).

## AppUser

The `AppUser` class has been renamed to `User`. The `username` field has been renamed to `identifier` to emphasize that it has to be a unique identifier.

The other fields such as `provider` have been removed. A new `metadata` field has been added instead. It is a dictionary that can be used to store any information about the user.

## AskUserMessage

The response of [AskUserMessage](/api-reference/ask/ask-for-input) has been slightly modified. The `content` field has been renamed to `output`.

## File Upload

File upload has been reworked to remove the size limit and vastly improve performance. The APIs stay the same with one exception.

The file objects returned by [AskFileMessage](/api-reference/ask/ask-for-file) and [multi modal messages](/advanced-features/multi-modal) no longer have the `content` of the file. Instead they have a `path` field that can be used to manipulate the file.

## Chainlit Cloud

Chainlit Cloud has been replaced by our entirely new platform called [Literal AI](https://docs.getliteral.ai).

Literal AI not only works out of the box with Chainlit apps but also with any other LLM app. Your historical data has been migrated automatically.

In your Chainlit app, replace your API key definition with:

```python
# BEFORE
CHAINLIT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

# AFTER
LITERAL_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Literal AI brings a lot of new features such as:

- User analytics
- Chat analytics
- Detailed traces
- Python & TypeScript SDKs to interact with your data

and more!
