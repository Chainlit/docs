## Updating Chainlit

Begin the migration by updating Chainlit to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade chainlit
```

## What changes?

Full changelog available [here](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#10500---2023-04-02).

## How to migrate?

### 1. Regenerate translations

Since translation files have been updated, you need to regenerate them. To do so, remove the `.chainlit/translations` folder and restart your application.

### 2. Update the multi_modal config setting

The `multi_modal` config setting has been updated. You can either remove the entire `./chainlit/config.toml` file and restart your app or update the `multi_modal` setting manually (example [here](http://localhost:3002/backend/config/features#default-configuration)).
