## Updating Chainlit

Begin the migration by updating Chainlit to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade chainlit
```

## What changes?

This upgrade introduces several improvements and breaking changes in the data structure of three objects: `CompletionGeneration`, `ChatGeneration`, and `GenerationMessage`. The Generation objects allow you to give visibility to Chainlit and Literal AI on what exactly is sent and returned from LLMs.

In addition to these code changes, the prompt playground is simplified with the removal of the template feature. This simplification means you no longer need to send both the prompt template and the formatted prompt to Chainlit.

## How to migrate?

You can search your codebase for these objects to see if any migration is necessary: `CompletionGeneration`, `ChatGeneration`, and `GenerationMessage`.

Start by removing the properties that have been deleted and renaming those that have been updated.

Following this, you can add any of the optional properties to achieve a more comprehensive observability setup.
