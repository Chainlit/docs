title: With LangChain
---

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps to create a Chainlit application integrated with [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- A working installation of Chainlit
- The LangChain package installed
- An OpenAI API key
- Basic understanding of Python programming

## Step 1: Create a Python file

Create a new Python file named `app.py` in your project directory. This file will contain the main logic for your LLM application.

## Step 2: Write the Application Logic

In `app.py`, import the necessary packages and define a factory function decorated with [@cl.langchain_factory](/api-reference/langchain/langchain-factory) that returns any LangChain instance. In this tutorial, we are going to use `LLMChain` to keep it simple. Here's the basic structure of the script:

<Note>
  If your agent does not have an async implementation, fallback to the sync
  implementation.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```python Async
import os
from langchain import PromptTemplate, OpenAI, LLMChain
import chainlit as cl

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_KEY"

template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

@cl.langchain_factory(use_async=True)
def factory():
    prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])
    llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), verbose=True)

    return llm_chain
```

```python Sync
import os
from langchain import PromptTemplate, OpenAI, LLMChain
import chainlit as cl

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_KEY"

template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

@cl.langchain_factory(use_async=False)
def factory():
    prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])
    llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), verbose=True)

    return llm_chain
```

</CodeGroup>

This function sets up an instance of `LLMChain` with a custom `PromptTemplate`. The `LLMChain` is responsible for generating responses based on the input provided by users.

Behind the scenes, Chainlit takes care of:

- Websocket connections
- Instantiating one LangChain instance per user session
- Pass the right [callback handler](/api-reference/langchain/callbacks) to the LangChain instance
- Running the LangChain instance on user input
- Sending the output of the LangChain instance back to the user

## Step 3: Run the Application

To start your LLM app, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `app.py`. Then run the following command:

```bash
chainlit run app.py -w
```

The `-w` flag tells Chainlit to enable auto-reloading, so you don't need to restart the server every time you make changes to your application. Your chatbot UI should now be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

<Warning>
  When using LangChain, prompts and completions are cached locally! The cache
  lives in the .chainlit folder. You can start the app with the `--no-cache`
  flag to disable it.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've just created your first LLM app with Chainlit and LangChain. From here, you can:

- Learn more about the [LangChain integration](/api-reference/langchain)
- Add [elements](/concepts/elements) and [actions](/concepts/actions) to create a more sophisticated app

Happy coding! 🎉
