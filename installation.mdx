Chainlit requires `python>=3.8`.

You can install Chainlit it via pip as follows:

```bash
pip install chainlit
```

This will make the `chainlit` command available on your system.

Make sure everything runs smoothly:

```bash
chainlit hello
```

This should spawn the chainlit UI and ask for your name like so:
![Hello](/images/hello.png)
